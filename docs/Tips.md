Cyril tips:
22:47 Cyril: I'm going to leave, but here's a few tips:
22:47 Cyril: - replace the friend list by a GxsId list. There's a widget for that in GUI already. See the one that is used in the message composer window.
22:48 Cyril: - when openning a game, request a tunnel to RsGxstunnel. As soon as the tunnel is open, notify the UI and start the game. Use the tunnel to send/serialize the chess data items
22:49 defnax: normaly let option play with direct or distant people
22:49 Cyril: well, it's probably simpler to do everything with GxsIds rather than attempting to manage the two kinds of ids at the same time
