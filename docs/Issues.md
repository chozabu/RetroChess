# some issues of RetroChess :

1. you can start a game without the friend accepted (not allow).
2. disable invite button when friend has no chess installed/running
3. when leave chess, feature to send info to friend that he leaved chess on Chat window or Chess Window...
4. on Chess maindow it shows the active games, maybe remove leaved ones
5. i can move friends chess figures not allow
6. chess window is not realy optimized to big to much wasted spaces
7. seems the timer doesnt works
